//There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).
//
//Examples:
//
//Input: n = 1
//Output: 1
//Explanation: There is only one way to climb 1 stair.
//        Input: n = 2
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There are 2 ways to reach 2th stair: {1, 1} and {2}.
//Input: n = 4
//Output: 5
//Explanation: There are five ways to reach 4th stair: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1} and {2, 2}.
//Constraints:
//        1 ≤ n ≤ 44
