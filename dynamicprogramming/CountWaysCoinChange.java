//Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ].
//Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
//Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer.
//
//Examples:
//
//Input: coins[] = [1, 2, 3], sum = 4
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Four Possible ways are: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3].
//Input: coins[] = [2, 5, 3, 6], sum = 10
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Five Possible ways are: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 6], [2, 3, 5] and [5, 5].
//Input: coins[] = [5, 10], sum = 3
//Output: 0
//Explanation: Since all coin denominations are greater than sum, no combination can make the target sum.
//Constraints:
//        1 <= sum <= 103
//        1 <= coins[i] <= 104
//        1 <= coins.size() <= 103
