//Problem statement
//You and your friend Ninjax are playing a game of coins. Ninjax place the 'N' number of coins in a straight line.
//
//The rule of the game is as follows:
//
//        1. Each coin has a value associated with it.
//
//        2. It’s a two-player game played against an opponent with alternating turns.
//
//3. At each turn, the player picks either the first or the last coin from the line and permanently removes it.
//
//4. The value associated with the coin picked by the player adds up to the total amount the player wins.
//Ninjax is a good friend of yours and asks you to start first.
//
//Your task is to find the maximum amount you can definitely win at the end of this game.
//
//        Note:
//
//        'N' is always even number.
//
//Ninjax is as smart as you, so he will play so as to maximize the amount he wins.
//        Example 1:
//Let the values associated with four coins be: [9, 5, 21, 7]
//
//Let’s say that initially, you pick 9 and Ninjax picks 7.
//Then, you pick 21 and Ninjax picks 5.
//So, you win a total amount of (9+21), i.e. 30.
//
//In case you would have picked up 7 initially and Ninjax would have picked 21 (as he plays optimally).
//Then, you would pick 9 and Ninjax would choose 5. So, you win a total amount of (7+9), i.e. 16, which is not the maximum you can obtain.
//
//Thus, the maximum amount you can win is 30.
//Example 2:
//Let the values associated with four coins be: [20, 50, 5, 10]
//
//Let’s say that initially, you pick 10 and Ninjax picks 20.
//Then, you pick 50 and Ninjax picks 5.
//So, you win a total amount of (10+50), i.e. 60.
//
//In case you would have picked up 20 initially and Ninjax would have picked 50 (as he plays optimally).
//Then, you would pick 10 and Ninjax would choose 5. So, you win a total amount of (20+10), i.e. 30, which is not the maximum you can obtain.
//
//Thus, the maximum amount you can win is 60.
//Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
//Constraints:
//        1 <= 'T' <= 10
//        2 <= 'N' <= 10 ^ 3
//        0 <= 'VALUE' <= 10 ^ 5
//
//Where 'T' is the number of test cases, 'N' is the number of coins and 'VALUE' is the amount on each coin.
//
//Time Limit: 1 sec
//Sample Input 1:
//        2
//        2
//        7 8
//        4
//        5 30 4 1
//Sample Output 1:
//        8
//        31
//Explanation For Sample Input 1:
//For the first test case, you can pick the maximum value between 7 and 8, which is 8. Thus, Ninjax has to pick up 7.
//
//So, you win a total amount of 8.
//For the second test case, first, you pick 1, Ninjax picks 5. Then, you pick 30 and Ninjax picks 4, which is the only coin left. So, you win a total amount of (1 + 30) 31.
//Sample Input 2:
//        3
//        4
//        0 5 1 7
//        6
//        1 2 3 4 5 6
//        4
//        5 5 5 5
//Sample Output 2:
//        12
//        12
//        10
